# Differential Drive Robot

This project implements a **Differential Drive Robot** using **ROS1**, focusing on motion control, URDF modeling, and sensor-based mapping. The system integrates multiple sensors for environment perception and autonomous navigation.

---

## Features

- **Motion Control:**
  - Implemented kinematics and dynamics for differential drive movement.
  - Controlled robot velocity and trajectory using ROS.

- **URDF Modeling:**
  - Designed and simulated a **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** model for visualization in **RViz**.
  - Defined robot parameters including wheelbase, joints, and collision properties.

- **Sensor-Based Mapping:**
  - Utilized **IR and Ultrasonic Sensors** for obstacle detection and environment mapping.
  - Implemented **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** for real-time tracking.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Robot Operating System (ROS1)**
- **Gazebo & RViz** for simulation and visualization
- **URDF** for robot modeling
- **IR & Ultrasonic Sensors** for mapping
- **Encoders** for position tracking
